# Logging Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve verbose logging issues in the Next.js boilerplate.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Verbose Build Logging
**Problem**: The build process was generating excessive verbose logs, making it difficult to see important build information.

**Root Cause**: Environment variables `DEBUG="*"` and `LOG_LEVEL="debug"` were set in `.env.local`.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `DEBUG="*"` and `LOG_LEVEL="debug"` from `.env.local`
- Updated `env.local.example` to remove these variables from the template

### 2. Tailwind CSS Log Files
**Problem**: Tailwind CSS was generating debug log files (`tailwindcss-*.log`) in the project root directory.

**Root Cause**: Debug logging was enabled in Tailwind CSS configuration.

**Solution**:
- Created `tailwind.config.ts` with proper configuration
- Updated `postcss.config.mjs` to disable debug logging
- Added `tailwindcss-*.log` to `.gitignore` (already present)

### 3. Drizzle ORM Verbose Logging
**Problem**: Drizzle ORM was generating verbose logs during database operations.

**Root Cause**: `verbose: true` was set in `drizzle.config.ts`.

**Solution**: Changed `verbose: false` in `drizzle.config.ts`.

## Files Modified

1. **`.env.local`** - Removed debug environment variables
2. **`env.local.example`** - Removed debug environment variables from template
3. **`drizzle.config.ts`** - Set `verbose: false`
4. **`postcss.config.mjs`** - Added debug: false configuration
5. **`tailwind.config.ts`** - Created new configuration file
6. **`package.json`** - Added `clean:logs` script
7. **`scripts/clean-logs.sh`** - Created cleanup script

## New Scripts

### Clean Logs
```bash
npm run clean:logs
```
This script removes any existing Tailwind CSS log files and other debug logs.

## Verification

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Build Test**: Run `npm run build` - should complete without verbose logging
2. **Dev Server Test**: Run `npm run dev` - should start without generating log files
3. **Log Files**: Check that no `tailwindcss-*.log` files are created

## Prevention

The following measures prevent future logging issues:

- `.gitignore` includes `tailwindcss-*.log` to prevent committing log files
- Environment variables are properly configured to avoid debug mode
- Configuration files have debug logging disabled by default

## Troubleshooting

If you still see verbose logging:

1. Check if `.env.local` has `DEBUG` or `LOG_LEVEL` variables
2. Ensure you're using the updated configuration files
3. Run `npm run clean:logs` to remove any existing log files
4. Restart your development server

## Notes

- The fixes maintain all functionality while reducing noise
- Build performance may improve slightly due to reduced logging overhead
- Debug information is still available through proper debugging tools when needed
